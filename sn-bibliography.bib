	abstract="Stencil computation is a basic part in a large variety of scientific computing programs, especially for those containing partial differential equations. Due to the limited memory bandwidth, it is a challenge to improve the parallel efficiency of stencil computation on modern supercomputers. Performance modeling is the most common method of performance analysis. In this paper, we propose the generic performance model based on Sunway TaihuLight which is powered by SW26010 heterogeneous many-core processors. The generic model indicates the interaction between the programs and the computing platform from the architecture perspective, and points out the performance bottlenecks of the programs from the optimization perspective. Furthermore, we propose the specific performance model of stencil computation on SW26010 processors, and optimize the performance of stencil computation under the guidance of the model. The experimental results show that the performance models proposed in this paper are effective---the average error ratio of the predicted performance is less than 7{\%}. Guided by the specific model, the optimized stencil computation achieves better performance than the unoptimized many-core version by 154.71{\%} on 4096 cores.",

	abstract="Stencil computation is a kind of memory intensive computing core widely used in image and video processing, large-scale science and engineering calculation, which has been taken as the object of performance optimization by many scientific researchers, including parallel acceleration, communication optimization, load balance, while the memory access optimization of stencil computation needs further research [1, 2]. Based on the self-developed supercomputer ``Sunlight'', this paper proposes an efficient parallel optimization method for the stencil algorithm. It includes multi-level optimization accelerated by MPI{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}multi-core, efficient DMA transmission, mutual concealment of communication and calculation, data reuse and other parallel optimization strategies. Experiments on Sunway platform show that the strategy proposed in this paper greatly improves the efficiency of the algorithm and the performance of the algorithm.",

	abstract = {Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) is an essential computation kernel for many data-analytic workloads running in both supercomputers and data centers. The intrinsic irregularity in SpMV is challenging to achieve high performance, especially when porting to new architectures. In this paper, we present our work on designing and implementing efficient SpMV algorithms on Sunway, a novel architecture with many unique features. To fully exploit the Sunway architecture, we have designed a dual-side multi-level partition mechanism on both sparse matrices and hardware resources to improve locality and parallelism. On one hand, we partition sparse matrices into blocks, tiles, and slices for different granularities. On the other hand, we partition cores in a Sunway processor into fleets, and further dedicate part of cores in a fleet as computation and I/O cores. Moreover, we have optimized the communication between partitions to further improve the performance. Our scheme is generally applicable to different SpMV formats and implementations. For evaluation, we have applied our techniques atop a popular SpMV format, CSR. Experimental results on 18 datasets show that our optimization yields up to 15.5x (12.3x on average) speedups.},

	abstract = {Stencil computations represent a very common class of nested loops in scientific and engineering applications. Exploiting vector units in modern CPUs is crucial to achieving peak performance. Previous vectorization approaches often consider the data space, in particular the innermost unit-strided loop. It leads to the well-known data alignment conflict problem that vector loads are overlapped due to the data sharing between continuous stencil computations. This paper proposes a novel temporal vectorization scheme for stencils. It vectorizes the stencil computation in the iteration space and assembles points with different time coordinates in one vector. The temporal vectorization leads to a small fixed number of vector reorganizations that is irrelevant to the vector length, stencil order, and dimension. Furthermore, it is also applicable to Gauss-Seidel stencils, whose vectorization is not well-studied. The effectiveness of the temporal vectorization is demonstrated by various Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel stencils.},
